/// A type for which abstract value equality forms a [partial equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_equivalence_relation).
/// For example, floating point numbers implement `Partially_Equatable` because the special value
/// "not a number" (NaN) cannot be compared to itself. The result of `NaN == NaN` is `none`.
///
/// # Remarks
///
/// Types that have multiple reasonable definitions of equality without one that is clearly what
/// most would consider equal should not implement this trait. Instead, multiple
/// `Partial_Equivalence` implementations should be provided and developers can select which to
/// apply in any given situation using a `with` block. For example, Unicode strings can be compared
/// either by their Unicode scalar sequence or by converting to normal form and comparing or
/// relative to some culture. As such, unicode strings should not implement `==`. On the other hand,
/// ASCII strings can be compared case sensitive or case insensitive, but the case sensitive
/// comparison is the one that would be clearly considered equal. So ASCII strings should provide
/// `==` that compares strings in a case sensitive manner.
///
/// This trait provides a way compare a type (or family of types) for abstract value equality. This
/// means that two objects/values are considered equal when their abstract values are substitutable
/// for each other. Typically, this means that they are behaviorally equal. That is, in almost all
/// ways the behavior of the two values is indistinguishable. Of course, there are some aspects of
/// an object that are not part of its abstract value but may still be behaviorally observable. For
/// objects, the first such aspect is object identity. If two references refer to the same object
/// (e.g. `a === b`) then they must necessarily be equal (i.e. `a == b`). However, the inverse is
/// not the case. This is because object identity is never considered to be part of the abstract
/// value of an object/value. Another example is types which have multiple internal representations
/// for a value. These internal representations may be distinguishable by certain operations or by
/// inspecting the bytes of the value, but they represent the same abstract value and should be
/// equal. A final example is that for floating point types `-0 == 0`. Here their are some
/// behavioral differences since `1/0 == Inf` while `1/-0 == -Inf`. Nevertheless, the sign of zero
/// is not considered to be part of the abstract value.
///
/// Generally, equality should reflect behavioral equality except for object identity and multiple
/// internal representations of a value. If equality is being defined in a way that treats values
/// that are behaviorally distinct in other ways as equal, one should strongly consider not
/// implementing `Partially_Equatable` and instead providing a `Partial_Equivalence`.
///
/// Because two values should be behaviorally equal to be considered equal, the `==` operation is
/// defined only over `const` values. This is because if two distinct mutable objects were
/// considered equal and one was mutated, then they would not longer be behaviorally equal. For
/// comparison on mutable values, use `Partial_Equivalence`.

    /// # Remarks
    ///
    /// This method must define a relationship, here represented with the '==' symbol, that has
    /// the following properties:
    ///
    /// * symmetry: a == b if and only if b == a (likewise a == b is `none` if and only if b == a is `none`)
    /// * transitivity: if a == b and b == c then a == c
    /// * substitutability: if a == b then it should be possible to substitute b for a in all
    ///   expressions that depend only on the abstract value of a. Put another way, a and b should
    ///   be behaviorally equal except for those aspects and operations that distinguish more than
    ///   just the abstract value.
    ///
    /// Implementations that do not have these properties can lead to unexpected behavior.
    ///
    /// Note that partial equality is not reflective. That is, there may be values such that a R a
    /// returns `none`.
    ///
    /// Implementing `==` properly on types that are not sealed requires extra caution to ensure
    /// that the implementation is symmetric even as new subtypes are added to the hierarchy. The
    /// `can_equal` method is provided to support this. To ensure symmetry be sure to call
    /// `other.can_equal(self)` and if the result is not `true` return the result of `can_equal`.
    /// Note that `can_equal` can return `none` indicating that the `other` value is not comparable.
    /// In that case `==` must also return `none`. However since `none or true` produces `true` one
    /// must be careful to not improperly use logical connectives.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// Here is an example of a typical implementation of `equals` for a class `Example` with two
    /// fields `a` and `b` that inherits from `Base` (which implements `Equatable`). Here, there is
    /// a special value `Example.Not_A_Value` that cannot be compared for equality.
    ///
    /// ```
    /// published fn equals(const self, other: Base) -> bool? overrides

    ///     if self === Example.Not_A_Value or other === Example.Not_A_Value => return none;

    ///     let can_equal = other.can_equal(self);

    /// because `Example.Not_A_Value == Example.Not_A_Value` should return `none`. Next it checks
    /// for reference equality between `self` and `other` to optimize that case. It then ensures
    /// that `other` can be compared to `self` for equality by calling `other.can_equal(self)`.
    /// Note that only if `true` is returned does it go on to check for equality. Otherwise, it
    /// returns the result of the call to `can_equal`. It finishes by checking that other is an
    /// instance of the type `Example` and that all fields are equal.
