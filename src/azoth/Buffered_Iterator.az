/// An iterator that has buffered all the items of the collection. This allows subsequent iterators
/// to be optimized since all the elements are held in a buffer that can be mutated.
/// TODO does this really help performance? Reverse and sort are the things that would have a buffer
/// and they won't be followed by much other than `to_list()`. But maybe the list can take ownership
/// of the buffer.
